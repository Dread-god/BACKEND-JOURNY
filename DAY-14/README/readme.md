## 📌 What this project does
- Fetches users from a public API
- Uses Promise chaining (`then / catch / finally`)
- Filters users based on email domain
- Displays user data in a readable format
- Simulates delay before API call

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Promises
- Fetch API
- Error handling
- Array methods (`filter`)
- Clean code structure

## 🔗 API Used
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

## 🚀 How to Run
Just run the file in a browser console or a JS runtime that supports `fetch`.
