# JavaScript Internals & Async Patterns

This repository contains small experiments and demos to understand
how JavaScript works under the hood.

## Topics Covered
- Event Loop (Microtask vs Task Queue)
- Microtask Starvation
- Stack vs Heap Memory
- Promises & async/await
- Retry logic without libraries

## Why this repo?
Instead of rushing frameworks, this repo focuses on
execution model, runtime behavior, and async internals.

This knowledge is foundational for backend systems and Node.js.
